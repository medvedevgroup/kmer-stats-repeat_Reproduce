MissingOutputException in rule run_kmer_info in file /home/hvw5426/kmer-stats-repeat_Reproduce/kmer_info/snakefile, line 19:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
chr21_centromere/kmer_info.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: diff_counts.txt, occ_counts.txt)
Removing output files of failed job run_kmer_info since they might be corrupted:
